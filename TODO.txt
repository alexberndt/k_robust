To do list
----------

1. In Run() we choose our solver. We need to add to the CBS constructor a 
new parameter to mark that we in our new MAPF variant.

2. Change ClassicASrar expansion such that a location will not be visited
if we've already been there in the last k previous locations.

3. In TimeMove.UpdateConflictCount we identify conflicts (conflictRange parameter represents the k
value of k robust, you can use it). We need to add our new conflict type in case the search is in
our MAPF variant and we identify this new conlict.

4. In CbsConstraint constructor we define our constraint. Again, we meed to mark the cbs constraint
in case this is our variant and this is the new type of constraint.

5. In cbsNode.GetConstraints we collect all the constraints from our cbs node ancestors.
Here, in case it is the new type of constraint we need define exactly the agent restrictions.
